# NOTE: Updating code does NOT affect the volume
# When you run `docker compose up -d --build`:
# - New container image is built with your code
# - Old container is gracefully stopped
# - VOLUME STAYS ATTACHED - WhatsApp auth preserved
# - New container starts with existing state
#
# To destroy everything (including WhatsApp auth):
#   docker compose down
#   docker volume rm don-claudio-state
#   docker compose up -d --build  # Fresh start, will need WhatsApp re-auth
